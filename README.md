# IPL_Win_probability
Welcome to the "IPL Win Predictor" project! This machine learning model, built using logistic regression, predicts the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on the current match situation. Get ready to make data-driven predictions!

## About This Project
The "IPL Win Predictor" leverages logistic regression to provide insights into the probability of a team winning an IPL match. This model analyzes various match features, team performance, and player statistics to offer real-time predictions.

## Explore the Project

### Features 
* Real-Time Predictions: Get live predictions for IPL match outcomes based on the current match situation.

* Interactive Interface: The predictor is deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring match scenarios.

* Customizable Inputs: Adjust the match parameters and teams to simulate different match scenarios.

* Deployment: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and sharing.

### Usage
To make predictions, provide the following parameters when prompted:

* Batting Team: The team currently at bat.
* Bowling Team: The team currently bowling.
* City: The location of the match.
* Current runs: The current score of batting team.
* Overs Completed: The number of overs completed.
* Wickets: The number of wickets lost.
* Target Runs: The total runs scored by a bowling team.
The predictor will calculate the probability of the batting team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
